						C++ - I learned how to use this language in my second undergraduate year and found that my existing experience with object-oriented programming gave me transferable skills for working with C++, and I quickly adjusted to its syntactical differences. I learned how to work with pointers and references.
					</li>
					<li class="sitetext" id="cs">
						C# - I used C# while working on different games with the Unity engine.
					</li> 
					<li class="sitetext" id="gdscript">
						GDScript - This is the integrated language of the Godot engine. Its syntax is very similar to Python.
					</li>
					<li class="sitetext" id="java">
						Java - I have worked with Java since the start of my undergraduate course and have learned a lot about it. I have used it various times for Android development. I have also learned how to use the Spring Boot framework for web development.
					</li>
					<li class="sitetext" id="python">
						Python - I have made extensive use of Python's various libraries. I have used PySpark for data analytics. I have used the BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from web pages and output it to spreadsheet files.
